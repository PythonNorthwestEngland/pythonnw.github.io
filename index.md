Python North West is a Python user group based in Manchester.

We're currently looking for a venue to get restarted after a long period of absence following COVID-19.

If you can help provide a venue suitable for meetups and talks, please get in touch: **ben [at] bennuttall [dot] com**

Due to extortionate rising costs we have left Meetup.com - so please watch this space (and our new social channels) for updates.
