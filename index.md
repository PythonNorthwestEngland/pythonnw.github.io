Python North West are a Python user group based in Manchester. We meet on the third Thursday of each month to discuss all things Python. Open to Pythonistas of all ages and experience levels for talks, discussion and occassional coding.

To find out about our upcoming events, find us on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-North-West-Meetup/).

Our Meetups rely on input from our dedicateed and enthusiastic community. If you would like to help us put on an event by volunteering to do a talk, run a workshop, or lead a code session, please let us know using the [Sign Up Form](https://forms.gle/SbxhHN6XessL3JcA6).

If leading a session isn't for you, but you have an idea of a topic you'd be interested in attending a Meetup on, let us know on Meetup, via Twitter, or email.
