_This code of conduct is based upon [https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)_

The Python North West community is made up of members with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Python North West a positive, successful, and growing community.

## Our Community 

Members of the Python North West community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on talks, patches, problems, or otherwise.
- **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
- **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of
the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python North West community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labour was completed simply for the good of the community.
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
- **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
- **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
- **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
