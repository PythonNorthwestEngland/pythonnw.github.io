# Code of Conduct

See [https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

The Python NW community is made up of members with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community,
this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Python NW a positive, successful, and growing community.

## Our Community

Members of the Python NW community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on talks, patches, problems, or otherwise.
- **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
- **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of
the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python NW community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labour was completed simply for the good of the
community.
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of
our efforts.
- **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
- **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users.
- **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're
accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python NW community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity,  nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

### Inappropriate Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of any participants in any form

### Consequences

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the Python NW community Code of Conduct team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets. The full list of consequences for inappropriate behaviour is listed in the [Enforcement Procedures](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement). Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.

## Scope

### Python NW Events

This Code of Conduct applies to the following people at events hosted by the Python NW meetup group:

- Python NW organising committee
- speakers
- panelists
- tutorial or workshop leaders
- organizers
- volunteers
- all attendees

The Code of Conduct applies in official venue event spaces, including:

- walkways, hallways, elevators, and stairs that connect any of the above spaces

Event organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. Each event is required to provide a Code of Conduct committee that receives, evaluates, and acts on incident reports. Each event is required to provide contact information for the committee to attendees. The event
Code of Conduct committee may (but is not required to) ask for advice from the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group. The

The Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group will
receive and evaluate incident reports from the online communities listed above. The Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group will
work with online community administrators/moderators to suggest actions
to take in response to a report. In cases where the
administrators/moderators disagree on the suggested resolution for a
report, the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct work group may
choose to notify the Python Software Foundation board.
